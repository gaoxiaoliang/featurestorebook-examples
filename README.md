# featurestorebook-examples

This repository contains my hands-on practice and experiments based on the book  
**Building Machine Learning Systems with a Feature Store** (O’Reilly).

The goal of this repo is to better understand feature store concepts by
implementing and running the examples locally, mainly using **Hopsworks**.
